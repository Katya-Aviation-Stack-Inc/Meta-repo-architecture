# Cold-Jet Software Control Core

This module implements control for reactive thrust via super-cooled air streams, modeling air mass behavior and providing 3D vectoring without moving parts.

## Features

- Super-cooled air stream control.
- Air mass behavior modeling.
- Thrust dynamics and stability simulation.
- 3D vectoring without physical parts.

## Structure

- `src/`: C/C++ code for control algorithms.
- `docs/`: Documentation and aerodynamic modeling details.

## Building

Use CMake to build the module. Refer to the top-level README for general instructions.
