# Air Swarm OS

This module implements a distributed operating system for air traffic management, where aircraft act as blockchain-like nodes for conflict avoidance and route consensus.

## Features

- Aircraft as network nodes.
- Distributed state storage.
- Conflict avoidance and priority zone agreement.
- Interaction for route confirmation.

## Structure

- `src/`: C/C++ code for swarm OS and consensus algorithms.
- `docs/`: Documentation and air traffic management details.

## Building

Use CMake to build the module. Refer to the top-level README for general instructions.
