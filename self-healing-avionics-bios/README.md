# Self-Healing Avionics BIOS

This module implements a C-based BIOS that detects and repairs memory damage, reconfigures avionics buses, and restores module parameters autonomously.

## Features

- Memory damage detection and repair.
- Reconfiguration of avionics buses.
- Autonomous restoration of parameters.
- New paradigm in avionics reliability.

## Structure

- `src/`: C code for BIOS and self-healing routines.
- `docs/`: Documentation and avionics integration details.

## Building

Use CMake to build the module. Refer to the top-level README for general instructions.
