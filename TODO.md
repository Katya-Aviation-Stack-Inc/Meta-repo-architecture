# TODO: Meta-repo-architecture Setup

- [ ] Update top-level README.md to describe the meta-repo and list all 10 technologies with brief descriptions.
- [ ] Update .gitignore to handle C/C++ builds (e.g., add build/, *.o, etc.).
- [ ] Create top-level docs/ directory.
- [ ] Create subdirectories for each technology: air-to-air-mesh, neuro-fcc, self-adaptive-rotor-blades, cold-jet, local-gravity-field-navigation, predictive-airflow-engine, self-healing-avionics-bios, vortex-shield, air-swarm-os, star-nav-core.
- [ ] For each technology subdirectory, create src/, docs/, and README.md.
- [ ] Populate each module's src/ with basic C/C++ stubs or placeholders.
- [ ] Add build systems (e.g., CMake) if needed.
- [ ] Test the structure by listing directories.
