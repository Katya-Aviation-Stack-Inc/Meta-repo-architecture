# Vortex Shield

This module implements a C/C++ system for suppressing vortex ring state in helicopters through pressure analysis, flow dynamics prediction, and corrective control adjustments.

## Features

- Pressure analysis for vortex detection.
- Flow dynamics prediction.
- Corrective adjustments to pitch, thrust, and vector.
- Vibration response and resonance control.

## Structure

- `src/`: C/C++ code for analysis and control.
- `docs/`: Documentation and helicopter dynamics details.

## Building

Use CMake to build the module. Refer to the top-level README for general instructions.
