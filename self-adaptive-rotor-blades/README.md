# Self-Adaptive Rotor Blades

This module implements software for rotor blades with embedded micro-servo actuators, enabling real-time aerodynamic adjustments, vibration suppression, and resonance damping.

## Features

- Controlled blade geometry (twist, torsion, bending).
- Self-correction of vibrations.
- Dynamic resonance suppression.
- Algorithms in C/C++: DSP filters, adaptive optimization, real-time feedback loops.

## Structure

- `src/`: C/C++ source code for blade control algorithms.
- `docs/`: Documentation and technical specifications.

## Building

Use CMake to build the module. Refer to the top-level README for general instructions.
